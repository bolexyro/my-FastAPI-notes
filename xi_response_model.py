# FastAPI will use this return type to:

# 1. Validate the returned data. If the data is invalid
# (e.g. you are missing a field), it means that your app code is broken,
# not returning what it should, and it will return a server error instead of returning incorrect data.
# This way you and your clients can be certain that they will receive the data and the data shape expected.
# 2. Add a JSON Schema for the response, in the OpenAPI path operation. This will be used by the automatic docs.
# It will also be used by automatic client code generation tools.
# But most importantly:

# 3. It will limit and filter the output data to what is defined in the return type.
# This is particularly important for security, we'll see more of that below.


# In a case where you want to return some data that is not exactly what the type declares
# For example, you could want to return a dictionary or a database object, but declare it as a Pydantic model.
# This way the Pydantic model would do all the data documentation, validation, etc.
# for the object that you returned (e.g. a dictionary or database object).

# If you added the return type annotation, tools and editors would complain with a
# (correct) error telling you that your function is returning a type (e.g. a dict) that is different from what you declared (e.g. a Pydantic model).

# a work around for this issue is to use the response_model as shown below
# FastAPI will use this response_model to do all the data documentation, validation, etc.
# and also to convert and filter the output data to its type declaration

# If you declare both a return type and a response_model, the response_model will take priority and be used by FastAPI.
# This way you can add correct type annotations to your functions even when you are returning a type different than the response model,
# to be used by the editor and tools like mypy. And still you can have FastAPI do the data validation, documentation, etc. using the response_model.

# Here, even though our path operation function is returning the same input user that contains the password,
# we declared the response_model to be our model UserOut, that doesn't include the password:

# So, FastAPI will take care of filtering out all the data that is not declared in the output model (using Pydantic).
# In this case, because the two models are different, if we annotated the function return type as UserOut,
# the editor and tools would complain that we are returning an invalid type, as those are different classes.
# That's why in this example we have to declare it in the response_model parameter.


# using response_model means that we don't get the support from the editor and tools checking the function return type.
# But in most of the cases where we need to do something like this, we want the model just to filter/remove some of the data as in the example above
# And in those cases, we can use classes and inheritance to take advantage of function type annotations
# to get better support in the editor and tools, and still get the FastAPI data filtering.

# from editors and mypy as this code is correct in terms of types, but we also get the data filtering from FastAPI.
@app.post("/user2/")
async def create_user(user: UserIn) -> BaseUser:
    return user


# The reasoning behind it
# BaseUser has the base fields. Then UserIn inherits from BaseUser and adds the password field,
# so, it will include all the fields from both models.

# We annotate the function return type as BaseUser, but we are actually returning a UserIn instance.

# The editor, mypy, and other tools won't complain about this because, in typing
# terms, UserIn is a subclass of BaseUser, which means it's a valid type when what is expected is anything that is a BaseUser.
# Now, for FastAPI, it will see the return type and make sure that what you return includes only the fields that are declared in the type.


# Other types of response
# Suppose you want to return something that is not a pydantic model
# tools will also be happy because both RedirectResponse and JSONResponse are subclasses of Response, so the type annotation is correct.

# if you have models with many optional attributes in for example a NoSQL database,

# those default values won't be included in the response, only the values actually set.
# So, if you send a request to that path operation for the item with ID foo, the response (not including default values) will be:

{
    "name": "Foo",
    "price": 50.2
}
# But if your data has values for the model's fields with default values, like the item with ID bar:


{
    "name": "Bar",
    "description": "The bartenders",
    "price": 62,
    "tax": 20.2
}
# they will be included in the response.
# If the data has the same values as the default ones, like the item with ID baz:


{
    "name": "Baz",
    "description": None,
    "price": 50.2,
    "tax": 10.5,

}
# FastAPI is smart enough (actually, Pydantic is smart enough) to realize that,
# even though description, tax, and tags have the same values as the defaults,
# they were set explicitly (instead of taken from the defaults).

# So, they will be included in the JSON response.

# response_model_include and response_model_excludeÂ¶
# You can also use the path operation decorator parameters response_model_include and response_model_exclude.
# They take a set of str with the name of the attributes to include (omitting the rest) or to exclude (including the rest).
# This can be used as a quick shortcut if you have only one Pydantic model and want to remove some data from the output.

# But it is still recommended to use the ideas above, using multiple classes, instead of these parameters.
# This is because the JSON Schema generated in your app's OpenAPI (and the docs)
#  will still be the one for the complete model, even if you use response_model_include or response_model_exclude to omit some attributes.

# This also applies to response_model_by_alias that works similarly.

# If you forget to use a set and use a list or tuple instead for the inclue or exclude, FastAPI will still convert it to a set and it will work correctly:
