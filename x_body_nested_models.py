# If the top level value of the JSON body you expect is a JSON array
# (a Python list), you can declare the type in the parameter of the function, the same as in Pydantic models:


@app.post("/images/multiple/")
async def create_multiple_images(images: list[Image]):
    return images

# Bodies of arbitrary dictsÂ¶
# You can also declare a body as a dict with keys of some type and values of some other type.
# This way, you don't have to know beforehand what the valid field/attribute names are (as would be the case with Pydantic models).
# This would be useful if you want to receive keys that you don't already know.
# Another useful case is when you want to have keys of another type (e.g., int).
# That's what we are going to see here.
# In this case, you would accept any dict as long as it has int keys with float values:

# Keep in mind that JSON only supports str as keys.
# But Pydantic has automatic data conversion.
# This means that, even though your API clients can only send strings as keys, as long as those strings contain pure integers, Pydantic will convert them and validate them.
# And the dict you receive as weights will actually have int keys and float values.


@app.post("/index-weights/")
async def create_index_weights(weights: dict[int, float]):
    return weights
